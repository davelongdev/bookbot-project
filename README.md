# Static Analysis Tool (Python)

A short command-line app that does static analysis on text files.

I created this project while working through the Build a Bookbot project for learning back-end develpment and programming on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

The original project code is contained in boot-dev-project.py

I've added a bit more functionality to the original project.  The new project is contained in main.py

I'm planning to add additional functionality when I have a chance.  Some ideas to implement:

- Allow the user to pass in an argument on the command line with a file location.
- Send the output to a txt file instead of just printing to the command line.
- Send the output to as csv for use in excel, google sheets, or pandas.
