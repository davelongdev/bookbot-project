# Static Analysis Tool (Python)

A short command-line app that does static analysis on text files.

I created this project while working through the Build a Bookbot project for learning back-end develpment and programming on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

This repo is a work in progress.  I'm in the process of editing the source code.  I will be uploading it soon.

I'm planning to add additional functionality when I have a chance.
